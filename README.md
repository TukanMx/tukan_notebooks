# TUKAN in Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to this [TUKAN](https://tukanmx.com/) tutorial on Jupyter Notebooks!

TUKAN is an API and web-platform that allows you to access multiple public data sources at a single location and under the same standard, so you and your team can focus on what matters. The analysis.

These Jupyter Notebooks provide useful examples and use-cases that showcase the power of our API and data-catalog. You can download the repository and execute `jupyter notebook` from your terminal to try out the notebooks locally on your own machine.

Alternatively, you can immediately launch live versions of the Tutorial notebooks in your browser on mybinder.org.

**Disclaimer:** TUKAN is a paid service, therefore these notebooks will only be exectuable / modifiable if you have an access token. However, we have executed these examples so you can see the output and use-cases without having a suscription to our product. If you wish to request a demo of our API, we inivte you to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ3B_YHOsYqTDXCwSrQ216bGKTSwEY2O-Skp-vcLafKKDQJQ/viewform).
